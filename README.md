# B+Tree proof of concept

This repository contains a basic implementation of a B+Tree. I implemented this as a proof of 
concept to learn the implementation details of a b+tree with the goal of using this data 
structure as a file storage mechanism for my 
[eMbedded Key-Value Database](https://github.com/mathmoi/mkvDb) project.

## How to build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathmoi/btree-poc.git
cd btree-poc
